# TheDAOETCTokenBalance
Scripts and data to compute the balances of The DAO token holders on the Ethereum Classic chain

There is a plan for the Goodies who have retrieved ethers from The DAO and it's child DAOs on the Ethereum Classic chain to distribute the ethers (ETC) to The DAO token holders (DTH) based on the DTH's holding just prior to the hard-fork at block 1,919,999 - see [The White Hats and DAO Wars: Behind the Scenes](https://blog.bity.com/2016/08/13/the-white-hats-and-dao-wars-behind-the-scenes/). Some DTH would prefer to have the ETCs distributed according to the current DTH's holding - see [Reddit - The White Hats and DAO Wars: Behind the Scenes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4xlxd3/the_white_hats_and_dao_wars_behind_the_scenes/).

A script is currently being written to extract The DAO token and ether balances of DTHs just prior to the hard-fork and currently.
